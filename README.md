# QA Summary Report of the Assignment

This assignment covers testing of two android apps and two websites. I planned and executed a full test cycle that included functional, UI?UX, Security, Accessibility testing.

## Scope

- Android App 1: [App Testing service](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apptestingservice)
- Android app 2 : [Echo Chat](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.echogpt.chatapp)
- Website 1: [EcoGPT Web](https://echogpt.live/)
- Website 2 : [App Testing Service](https://apptestingservice.com/)

## Test Approach    
I followed a structured approach that of two android apps and two websites. I planned and executed a full test case that included functional, UI/UX, Security and Accessibility testing.

**The Tests Covered:**
* Functional and UI/UX behavior
* Navigation and Usability
* Security checks (authentication, input validation, basic vulnerabilities)
* Accessibility checks 
* Negative test cases with Fail verdict.

**DEvice and OS Used;** 
1. Android 15 (Xiaomi Redmi note 13 4G)
2. Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (HP probook 450G)

## Test case and Test Plan 
I documented all the test cases and Bug report in a spreadsheet and and added the test plan in a separate document.

## Execution Summary
All test case were executed on real devices. I tracked Pass/Fail results, app version and environments. I have done almost 25 testcase for every scope and also provide the precondition, steps to execute, Expected and Actual result. 
A fiew issues were identified during functional, UI, Security and Accessibility testing. 

**Bug Reports**
I reported a minimum of 3 valid bugs for each scope of this assignments. Each reports includes:
* Steps to reproduce
* Expected and Actual results.
* Severity and Priority.
* Environment Details
* Screenshot or Recording 

## Overall Findings:
Both apps and websites work, but there are several issues related to UI, navigation, and validation. These defects may affect user experience and should be fixed before release. 

**Recommendations**
* Fix the reported bugs and retest.
* Input input validation and security controls.
* Run an additional accessinility review
* Recheck Ui consistency accross devices
* Perform another short regression test after fixes.
